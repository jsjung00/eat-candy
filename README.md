# Eat Candy!

**Eat Candy!** is a game where users attempt to eat falling candy before they fall off the screen.
### Motivation
I remember playing a game on a flip phone as a kid in the early 2000's where I had to eat candy falling from the screen using my mouth. At first I thought it was magic, but then I learned that the game wasn't as impressive as it often failed to detect my mouth in various lighting conditions and mistook my eyes and nose for my mouth. 
Fast forward to now, with robust facial landmark detection recongition models, I wanted to recreate the game that I remembered and improve the parts of the game I wasn't fully satisfied with. This game uses tensorflow.js to determine the facial landmarks. 

## Game Play

Simply open your mouth and bite to "eat" candy before it falls off the screen. Try to eat as much candy as possible before losing all three lives!
